# Contributing

Hello there ðŸ‘‹,

If you want to contribute in the project then feel free to make a PR on <a href="https://github.com/shivam1317/Cybernotes">Github</a>

Just keep these things in mind while contributing:

1. The writeup or note must be written by yourself.
2. It must be easily understandable and in detail.
3. Add tags if you want.
4. For more help join my <a href="https://discord.gg/HwEUf6p2yW">discord server</a>
