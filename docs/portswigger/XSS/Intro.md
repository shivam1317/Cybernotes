## What is cross-site scripting (XSS)?

Cross-site scripting (also known as XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable application. It allows an attacker to circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to segregate different websites from each other. Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities normally allow an attacker to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, and to access any of the user's data. If the victim user has privileged access within the application, then the attacker might be able to gain full control over all of the application's functionality and data.

--> If `alert()` don't work then you can use `print()` which will do the same thing.

## What are the types of XSS attacks?

There are three main types of XSS attacks. These are:

- [Reflected XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting#reflected-cross-site-scripting), where the malicious script comes from the current HTTP request.
- [Stored XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting#stored-cross-site-scripting), where the malicious script comes from the website's database.
- [DOM-based XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting#dom-based-cross-site-scripting), where the vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code.

### Lab 1

--> In this lab we just have to use the common payload for xss :

```markup
<script>alert(1)</script>
```

And we solved the challenge!
